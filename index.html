				WELCOME TO DREAM LAND OF SARAN!<br>Canada is one of the world's most peaceful countries. It's also one of the safest. The Global Peace Index, which is produced by the Institute for Economics and Peace, consistently ranks Canada as very high in terms of peace and security.
				Canada has a large domestic and foreign tourism industry. The second largest country in the world, Canada's incredible geographical variety is a significant tourist attractor. Much of the country's tourism is centred in the following regions: Toronto, Montreal, Quebec City, Vancouver/Whistler, Niagara Falls, Vancouver Island, Canadian Rockies, British Columbia's Okanagan Valley, Churchill, Manitoba and the national capital region Ottawa. The large cities are known for their culture, diversity, as well as the many national parks and historic sites.

			Left Column : 230px<br>Join like-minded poetry lovers from across the world to discover new poetry and different cultures, share insights and language skills, working together to open up a poem in its original language and reassemble it in English. The result will be new group translations of contemporary Nigerian poems by Oladapo Olatubosun, Auwalu Anwar and Amarachi Attamah.

			To help in this task you will be guided by a translator who is an expert in the language that is the focus for that session, and a professional poet. They will offer insight into the nuances of the language and culture, and give helpful suggestions for the direction of the translation that is produced.

			Taking place online via Google Meet, the workshops are the perfect way to keep yourself feeling creative, engaged and connected to the world at large. A rough and ready guide translation is provided by the guest translator so there is no need to know the language being translated – simply sign up and bring your love of poetry and language.
